<h3><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong></h3>
<strong>The organizers of the South Side Pie Challenge will not assume any liability for adverse reactions to food consumed or items one may come in contact with while eating food purchased at the pie challenge.</strong>
<h3>THE RULES:</h3>
<strong>1.</strong> Anyone who wants to bake a pie that fits into our categories is eligible to enter. Residents from all South Side neighborhoods are welcome to participate – whether you live in the South Loop, Kenwood, Bronzeville, South Shore, Hyde Park, Woodlawn, or anywhere else south of downtown, you are invited to be a part of our challenge.

<strong>2.</strong> Contestants are limited to one entry per category but may enter in as many categories as they like, paying the registration fee each time. Categories are: Fruit, Nut, Crème, and Pumpkin/sweet potato. So, if you’re baking an apple pie, it goes in the “Fruit” category, pecan pie goes in “Nut,” etc. If you aren’t sure what category to choose for your delicious creation, just email us at southsidepie@gmail.com.

<strong>3.</strong> Each pie entry must include a name of the baker or team (a team may be mother and son, a couple, friends, etc.).

<strong>4.</strong> Each entered pie must have a unique name – like “Fall Harvest Pumpkin” or “Maggie’s Favorite Pie” or just “Steve.” Pie names and random numbers will be used for the judging round, without identifying the bakers, to insure anonymity. Names of bakers will be revealed after finalists are chosen.

<strong>5.</strong> Each registration/entry includes TWO IDENTICAL PIES delivered to the event at the time specified.

<strong>6.</strong> Online registration must be fully completed at the time of entry, including $30 registration fee.

<strong>7.</strong> Each pie should be delivered in a disposable pie pan – we cannot store and return pie pans.

<strong>8.</strong> Entry pies cannot require any special handling – refrigeration or heating will not be allowed on site.

<strong>9.</strong> The finished pie cannot contain raw/uncooked eggs (egg whites or egg yolks). If eggs are used in filling preparation, they must reach 160 degrees to be considered cooked.

<strong>10.</strong> The top three winners in each category will receive ribbons and prizes and be featured in our Winners’ Circle on the website.

<strong>11.</strong> All winners automatically give permission to have their photo taken and used on the South Side Pie Challenge website.

<strong>12.</strong> We will be collecting pie recipes from all the bakers for a South Side Pie Challenge Cookbook, which will be published online (more details to come). You are NOT required to submit your recipe, but we think it would be awesome if you did.

<strong>13.</strong> All pies will be available for purchase to the public after the winners are chosen. All pies will be sold at $5 a slice.

<strong>If you have any questions, please email us at southsidepie@gmail.com or contact us<a href="http://dev-longwebsitename-hyphenated.pantheonsite.io/contact-us/"> here</a></strong>
