Attending the venerable Bucktown Apple Pie Contest in 2011 left us wanting more pie. Down here, on the South Side, where we live, we invite all bakers to bring us their best. Our contest, sponsored in part by Illinois grain company Hodgson Mill, seeks to highlight the best of the South Side, bringing together chefs who share their pastry expertise as judges, local youth who volunteer to serve pie, talented home bakers young and old, south side businesses who support our event, and hundreds of neighbors who join us each year to celebrate pie.

And as we admire, judge, and eat pie we raise money for the Hyde Park/Kenwood Interfaith Council Hunger Programs. To date we have raised over $20,000 for their food pantry and soup kitchen. All proceeds from the South Side Pie Challenge will go directly to help people in our neighborhood who struggle with food insecurity. Please join us!
